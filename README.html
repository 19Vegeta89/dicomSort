<p>DicomSort is a utility that takes a series of DICOM images and sorts them into
a directory tree based upon the header fields selected.</p>
<p>This software has the following dependencies:
<ul>
    <li><a href="http://www.wxpython.org/download.php">wxPython 2.8</a></li>
    <li><a href="http://code.google.com/p/pydicom/">pydicom</a></li>
</ul>
</p>
Currently, this software performs decently day-to-day but has much room for
improvement. </p>

<p>The main thing I have been messing with lately is porting it to pyQt instead
of wxPython for improved portability and more available features.</p>

<p>Eventually, I will setup the wiki and generate some complete documentation</p>

DicomSort README
================

DicomSort is a utility that takes a series of DICOM images and sorts them into
a directory tree based upon the header fields selected.

This software has the following dependencies:
*   [wxPython 2.8](http://www.wxpython.org/download.php)
*   [pydicom](http://code.google.com/p/pydicom/) 

Currently, this software performs decently day-to-day but has much room for
improvement.

The main thing I have been messing with lately is porting it to pyQt instead
of wxPython for improved portability and more available features.

Eventually, I will setup the wiki and generate some complete documentation.
